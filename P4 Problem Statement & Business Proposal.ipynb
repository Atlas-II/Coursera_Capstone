For this case we have used the city of Toronto.\n\nThroughout the world, people travel, move homes, set up businesses. Location and the facilities near that location are very important for this. This project is for people looking for locations like Cafes, Grocery stores, Schools, Shopping Centres, Hardware stores, Hospitals, Clubs for like minded people.\n\nThis project aims to create an analysis of features for people migrating to Toronto to search for the best neighborhood through comparative analysis between the neighborhoods of Toronto. The features for comparison include median housing price, nearby school ratings, crime rates, road connectivity, weather conditions, emergency facilities, water resources and recreational facilities.\n\nIt will help people to get awaren of the area they are moving to and find the best possible location for their intended purpose."
